## Challenges that will soon be in this program!

1. If you haven't, try using parameterized queries to make your application more secure.

2. Let the users create their own habits to track. That will require that you let them choose the unit of measurement of each habit.

3. Seed Data into the database automatically when the database gets created for the first time, generating a few habits and inserting a hundred records with randomly generated values. This is specially helpful during development so you don't have to reinsert data every time you create the database.

4. Create a report functionality where the users can view specific information (i.e. how many times the user ran in a year? how many kms?) SQL allows you to ask very interesting things from your database.
