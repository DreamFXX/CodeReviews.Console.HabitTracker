## HabitTracker.ConsoleApp - by DreamFXX
# Cigarettes Consumption Tracker

Console based CRUD application to track time spent coding. Developed using C# and SQLite.
I used Visual Studio IDE for creation of this project.

Given Requirements:
 When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
 It should also create a table in the database, where the hours will be logged.
 You need to be able to insert, delete, update and view your logged hours.
 You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes
 The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
 You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework
 Reporting Capabilities
